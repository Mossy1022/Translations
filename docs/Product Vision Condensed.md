**Purpose**
- Break down language barriers so people can speak naturally and be understood instantly.

**Mission**
- Keep conversation **face‑to‑face, eyes‑up, uninterrupted**. Advanced STT/MT/TTS runs in the background; users don’t manage the mic.

**Core principles**
- **Simplicity:** minimal taps, no push‑to‑talk.
- **Speed & Fluidity:** minimize latency; early streaming (Peer) vs phrase‑commit (One‑Phone).
- **Natural feel:** normal tone; non‑robotic voices; haptic cues instead of screens.
- **Privacy:** offline‑first; user owns data.
- **Inclusivity:** EN↔ES first; scalable to more languages.

**Differentiators**
- Hands‑free, real‑time; proximity discovery; no special hardware; full‑duplex dialog; low‑latency conference mode; heavy offline priority.
